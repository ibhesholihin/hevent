## About this repo
This is a Rest API for Herald Event and Community App built by Go (Echo) according to *Clean architecture*.  
This app consists of 4 layers, **"Models"**, **"Stores/Repository"**, **"Services(Logic)"** and **"Handlers(Framework)"**.
Each layer only concerns/handles its inside layer, not the other way around.
This makes it super easy to replace each layer. (also good for testing)
